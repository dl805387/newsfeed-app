/*
    add an overlay affect where the screen turns dark besides the overlay div
    need to display the divs on the screen even if the user is scrolling down
    add scrollbar for replies view


    // maybe put a border around original tweet to distinguish it from retweet

    // when you click on delete, the page scrolls up because tweetsview gets shortened
    // you might be able to fix this by increasing the height by css styling
    // you can also not do this because we want to scroll up when retweet

    // maybe when user deletes, show something on the screen that says delete successful
